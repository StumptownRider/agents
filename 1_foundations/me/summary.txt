My name is Chris Iverson. I'm a product manager and tech enthusiast, with a background in Finance and Operations. I'm originally from Seattle, Washington, and have lived all over the Northwest.
I'm a foodie with a particular love for mexican cuisine, and anything that goes with coffee and chocholate. I love fresh mountain air, motorcycles, and travel.
